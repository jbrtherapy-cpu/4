      <h1 className="font-heading text-3xl mb-4">Individual Counselling</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">Individual counselling is a confidential, one-to-one therapeutic relationship. Sessions are typically 50 minutes and focused on your goals. We use evidence-based approaches such as CBT, ACT and trauma-informed care, integrated with a gentle, faith-aware perspective when helpful.</p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">How it works</h2>
      <p>In initial sessions we build a shared understanding of what brought you to therapy, your current strengths, and the patterns that maintain difficulty. We create a collaborative plan: small, measurable steps you can try between sessions to build momentum.</p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Session structure</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li>Assessment and rapport-building (first 1-3 sessions)</li>
        <li>Skill-building (breathing, grounding, behavioural experiments)</li>
        <li>Processing emotions and experiences</li>
        <li>Review and consolidation</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Who benefits?</h2>
      <p>This work helps with anxiety, depression, grief, life transitions, and relational concerns. It is suitable for people seeking practical tools and reflective space to understand and change patterns.</p>

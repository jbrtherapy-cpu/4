      <p className="mb-4">
        Islamic-informed counselling integrates faith, values, and psychological practice. It respects spiritual frameworks while using evidence-based therapeutic tools to support wellbeing, resilience, and mental health. Sessions are person-centred and tailored to your needs, whether you want therapy that explicitly engages with faith or prefer a secular approach that is sensitive to your beliefs.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">What to expect</h2>
      <p>
        Sessions are client-led and respectful of personal beliefs. We explore how spiritual practices, community, and meaning contribute to wellbeing and use them alongside cognitive and behavioural approaches to address difficulties such as low mood, anxiety, stress, trauma, and relationship concerns. You can expect a confidential, empathic space where goals are set collaboratively.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Clinical integration</h2>
      <p>
        We may incorporate practices such as dhikr, dua, reflective journaling, or values-based interventions when appropriate and agreed with you. We work collaboratively with any spiritual mentors or community supports you find helpful and will support coordinated care where that benefits your wellbeing.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Boundaries and ethics</h2>
      <p>
        Therapists do not provide religious rulings (fatwas) or replace the role of qualified religious scholars. Where specialised religious guidance is needed, we recommend consulting a trusted scholar alongside therapy. We follow professional ethical guidelines around confidentiality, safeguarding, and cultural competence.

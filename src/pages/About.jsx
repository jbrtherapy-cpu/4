      <p className="mb-4">Rida Therapy was founded by <strong>Jabran Rafiq</strong>, a counsellor committed to helping individuals and couples find balance, healing, and renewed connection. Jabran integrates evidence-based psychological approaches with a respectful, faith-sensitive perspective.</p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Counselling philosophy</h2>
      <p>Our approach blends empathy, practical skills and spiritual respect. We aim to create a safe space where you can explore feelings, learn tools for regulation, and build meaning.</p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Professional practice</h2>
      <p>Sessions are typically 50 minutes. We offer both in-person work in Manchester and online sessions for clients elsewhere. Confidentiality and professional boundaries are central to our practice.</p>
